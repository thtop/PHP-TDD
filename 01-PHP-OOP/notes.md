## PHP Classes and Objects

- A Class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
- Class = Data + Behavior
- class
  - variables
  - methods
- object
  - default values (NULL)
  - set values
  - display data
- ternary

---

## Bootstrapping An Object

- Constructor
- default values
- `__destruct()`
- types

---

## Encapsulation

- visibility or accessibility
- public
- private
- protected
- Getter & Setter

---

## Object Inheritance

- Inheritance
- Override

---

## Static Methods & Properties

- Static
- `self` or `static`
- Dynamic
- `$obj = new static`; static byding

---

## Method Chaining

- Inside static method use `return new static;`
- Inside dynamic method use `return $this;`

---

## Abstract Classes (Database Case Study)

1. Cannot be instantiated using the `new` keyword
2. Can contain properties, methods and abstract methods
3. Sub classless must provide their own implementation of any abstract methods
4. Abstract methods do not have a body

Case Study

Create a package that that allows client to connect, query and return data from the database as `stdClass` using either PDO or MySQLi API

- autoloading

## Object Interfaces (Predator and Prey Case Study)

Interface

1. An interface is a contract that specifies which methods a class must implement
2. An interface doesn't care about how the methods are implemented
3. An interface can only have publice menthods

Tips:

- Interfaces work best when they describe what something should do

Case Study

- Create a class that describe how Dogs chase and kill Rabbits
